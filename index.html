      <p class="about-me__description">
        Hi. My name is Abdelrahman (Abdel) Sayedahmed. I am 20 years old, born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. I am a native Arabic and English speaker. I have been programming since I was 14 years old. I started programming on drag and drop coding websites, Snap! by Berkeley. I then moved onto programming robots in my robotics class using the programming language C and C++. For the rest of my high school years, I learned Python and created some Python projects. After that, in college I took some electrical engineering classes and along side that I joined pursuit to become a software engineer. I learned JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React Framework.

      <h2 class="hardest-bug__title">Hardest Bug So Far</h2>
      <p class="hardest-bug__description">
        The hardest bug I encounter was a little funny. I was working on a research project on the fibonacci sequence. Part of the project was for me to create code that creates the sequence to a certian length. Problem is, when one lining the code, you can only start the sequence with 1, 1. but when you use a regular loop, you can start with 0, 1.
      </p>
      <p class="hardest-bug__solution">
        I went online to see what I can do so the one-liner can start with 0,1. Turns out, everyone on the internet has a different opinion on it. Some people you have to start with 0, 1 and others say it starts with 1, 1. So istead of fixing the bug, I presented both solutions and got away with it because not even the interent agreed on the solution.
